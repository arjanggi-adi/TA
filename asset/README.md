# Health-Monitoring-System-Smart-Sports
Monitor an athlete daily activity and capture relevant data for specific activity.

The aim of the project was to come up with a Remote Health monitoring System that can be made with locally available with a view of making it affordable if it were to be mass produced. The most common monitoring tools used in sports context today, are still pen and paper. In this thesis, we present an implemented digitized monitoring system, where we are monitoring a player’s daily activites, activeness, wellness, and injury through questionnaires. The system has made it easier to collect, process, store, analyze and present data using modern technologies. The application also provides useful visualization feedback, thus helps a player to monitor them self. The system also has a web portal, where a coach can analyze, evaluate and monitor players captured data. This player monitoring system can help sports clubs and athletes to ease the process of manually capturing and processing data, and rather have focus on monitoring and analyzing.
